I made these during December of 2025 to cover up holes in a PC case due to removing the CD readers/burners previously there. The PC case in question was a **HP Pavilion D4100Y tower case**, but only one panel of each kind was still with the case itself. So I measured up, designed a copy, and printed more of them at home on a *Creality Ender 3*. 
pretty generic settings; 
- support enabled, 
- 0.16mm layer height,
- 20% infill (but the models are solid),
- 60 degC print bed
- 200 degC nozzle,
- 1.75mm PLA (matte black)

Feel free to use the files. Below are some  pictures of my results.

P.S. if for some reason you want to buy one of these front bezels, I found [this site](https://www.impactcomputers.com/bezels/hp-front-main-bezel-assembly-5042-8811) selling them
